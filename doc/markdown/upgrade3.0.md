# Upgrading a Nitrogen app from 2.x to 3.0

* Run upgrade script (this only works if you use a Nitrogen 2.x generated application)

* (if you use jquery extensively), Add `Nitrogen.$jquery = jQuery` to your script

* (Ensure you start nitrogen_core now instead of just loading it) - update your nitrogen.app.src file
